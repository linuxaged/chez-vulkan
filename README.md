# chez-vulkan
Vulkan graphics API binding for Chez Scheme. vulkan.ss is auto-generated by generate-vulkan.ss from vulkan.xml auto-generated by castxml (--castxml-gccxml mode) from vulkan.h. There is no examples, tests or validation codes now.

## Libraries
- `(vulkan)`: contains almost of Vulkan API,
- `(vulkan constants)` defines some Vulkan constants omitted when auto-generating, and
- `(vulkan xlib)`: is needed for the platform support.

Other platforms are not supported now.
